    LINUX COMMANDS: 

    1. ls -> The ls command in Linux is used to list the files and directories in the current directory. It provides a simple way to view the contents of a directory. By default, it displays the names of files and directories in alphabetical order.

        Example:
            beryl@beryl-Latitude-7490:~$ ls

        a) -l->The -l option (long format) provides a detailed list, showing file permissions, ownership, size, modification date, and more for each file or directory.
                
            Example:
                beryl@beryl-Latitude-7490:~$ ls -l
                total 52

                Videos     snap    Pictures  GitDemo           Downloads  Desktop
                Templates  Public  Music     examples.desktop  Documents

        f) -R ->The -R option recursively lists the contents of subdirectories as well.

            Ozymandias

            I met a traveller from an antique land
            Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
            Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
            Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown
            And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
            Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
            Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,
            The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.
            And on the pedestal these words appear:
            "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
            Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
            Nothing beside remains: round the decay
            Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
            The lone and level sands stretch far away.
